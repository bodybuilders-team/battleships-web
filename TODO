- Ranking table cells could be clickable, and redirect to the player profile (Jesus)
- Add information about the number of played games, the number of wins and the number of losses in the player profile (Jesus)
- Custom ships

Both:
- Use cookies instead of local storage for auth
- Private games mechanism
- Server-side events for game state polling
- Add guest mode
